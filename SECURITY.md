# Security Policy and Guidelines

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in LogPose Token, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Email security@logpose.io with details
3. Allow up to 48 hours for initial response
4. Work with our team to resolve and disclose

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Smart Contract Development

1. **Access Control**
   - Use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` for owner functions
   - Implement role-based access where needed
   - Validate all administrative functions

2. **Token Security**
   - Implement safe transfer checks
   - Use SafeMath for calculations
   - Validate all inputs and state changes
   - Include emergency pause functionality

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - 100% test coverage for critical functions
   - Include edge case testing
   - Test with different network conditions
   - Implement fuzzing tests

### Development Environment

1. **Private Keys & Mnemonics**
   ```plaintext
   ‚ùå NEVER commit private keys
   ‚ùå NEVER share mnemonics
   ‚ùå NEVER use production keys in tests
   ‚úÖ Use .env for all sensitive data
   ‚úÖ Use separate test accounts
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create a new .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Required environment variables
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_development_private_key
   INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
   ```

3. **Deployment Security**
   - Use hardhat-deploy for reproducible deployments
   - Verify all contract parameters
   - Double-check network selection
   - Use multi-sig for admin functions

## üö® Critical Security Checks

### Pre-deployment Checklist

1. **Contract Verification**
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] Coverage report reviewed
   - [ ] Gas optimization completed
   - [ ] External audit completed
   - [ ] Known vulnerabilities checked

2. **Access Control**
   - [ ] Owner functions verified
   - [ ] Role assignments checked
   - [ ] Admin functions tested
   - [ ] Emergency controls verified

3. **Token Economics**
   - [ ] Supply limits verified
   - [ ] Minting controls checked
   - [ ] Transfer restrictions tested
   - [ ] Rate calculations verified

### Production Deployment

1. **Network Security**
   - Verify network connection
   - Check gas prices
   - Confirm contract addresses
   - Validate network state

2. **Contract Deployment**
   - Use verified deployment scripts
   - Confirm constructor parameters
   - Verify contract code on Etherscan
   - Test all main functions

3. **Post-deployment**
   - Verify owner addresses
   - Check token parameters
   - Test emergency functions
   - Monitor initial transactions

## üîç Audit Requirements

### Smart Contract Audit

1. **Required Scope**
   - All contract code
   - Deployment scripts
   - Access control systems
   - Token economics

2. **Audit Process**
   - Manual code review
   - Automated testing
   - Formal verification
   - Penetration testing

### Security Tools

1. **Required Tools**
   ```bash
   # Install security tools
   npm install --save-dev solhint
   npm install --save-dev slither-analyzer
   npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/test-helpers
   ```

2. **Regular Checks**
   ```bash
   # Run solhint
   npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
   
   # Run slither (if installed)
   slither .
   
   # Run coverage
   npx hardhat coverage
   ```

## üìù Documentation Requirements

1. **Code Documentation**
   - NatSpec comments for all functions
   - Clear state variable documentation
   - Event documentation
   - Error message documentation

2. **Security Documentation**
   - Known risks and mitigations
   - Administrative functions
   - Emergency procedures
   - Update procedures

## üîÑ Update Procedures

### Smart Contract Updates

1. **Preparation**
   - Full test suite passing
   - Security audit completed
   - Upgrade path documented
   - Backup procedures in place

2. **Implementation**
   - Use transparent proxy pattern
   - Test upgrade process
   - Verify state preservation
   - Document changes

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Emergency Pause**
   ```solidity
   // Emergency pause function
   function emergencyPause() external onlyOwner {
       _pause();
   }
   ```

2. **Recovery Process**
   - Identify issue
   - Implement fix
   - Test solution
   - Deploy update

## üìà Monitoring

1. **Transaction Monitoring**
   - Monitor large transfers
   - Track ownership changes
   - Watch for unusual patterns
   - Alert on emergency actions

2. **Network Monitoring**
   - Gas price tracking
   - Network status
   - Contract interactions
   - Error tracking

## ü§ù Responsible Disclosure

1. **Reporting Process**
   - Email security@logpose.io
   - Include detailed description
   - Provide reproduction steps
   - Suggest mitigation if possible

2. **Response Timeline**
   - Initial response: 48 hours
   - Assessment: 1 week
   - Fix development: 2 weeks
   - Public disclosure: Coordinated
